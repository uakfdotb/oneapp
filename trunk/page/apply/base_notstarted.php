<h1>General Application</h1>

<p>You have not yet started the general application. To start, simply click <a href="base.php?action=start">here</a>.</p>

<p>The general application is a series of questions that all clubs on the <?= $config['site_name'] ?> will consider. There may be additional questions that you are required to answer in the supplement section. Once both the general and supplemental applications have been completed, you will be able to submit a final version to a club. At that point, you will also be able to download your submission document.</p>

<p>Note that any changes to the general application made after you submit your application to a club will not be seen by that club. Furthermore, once submitted, your application cannot be revised and resubmitted. However, you may change your general application for different clubs.</p>
