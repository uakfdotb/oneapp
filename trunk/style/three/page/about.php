	<h3>OneApp</h3>
	<p>OneApp, initially designed in 2011, began as an online-application system with the intent to curb skewed executive selection processes. Whereas a standard application pool would have cronyism play a role in selection, a blind selection process with only qualifying traits displayed would act in benefit of the club. Additionally, an automated online system would be able to standardize the process from year-to-year and additionally save resources from avoiding excess printing. After receiving positive feedback from our school, we redesigned the application for a more general audience, leading to the OneApp.</p>
