[h3]What is OneApp?[/h3]
[p]OneApp provides a novel approach to the executive-selection process for school-related organizations. OneApp was created in early Winter 2011 to promote environmental conversation techniques, sustain simplicity for administrations to select future club officers, and engineer one thorough application for applicants to complete only once and submit to all clubs. OneApp offers a user-friendly interface, and applicants can fill out personal information, and current officials can organize the submitted files by their choosing. Additionally, OneApp provides an outstanding template for current administrators to use. With simple alteration features, this application can meet the needs of every organization.

The current template asks for the following information: basic biographical information, previous extracurricular activities, previous leadership experience, course work, academic information, and open-ended short answer questions. We also include an optional peer evaluation form since we believe that an effective leader has strong support from members of the community. We provide an option for communal voting on multiple candidates.

We organize our users into three different types: Root, Administration, and Applicant. Root allows the single user to organize the main page within the set domain. Additionally, Root can create administrative accounts and delete excess documents. Administrative accounts are able to create files on the General Application and on the supplements. Additionally, administrators can view the submitted PDFs and write comments in each application. Applicants then complete the application, obtain any necessary peer recommendations, and submit the compiled document as a PDF (portable document format).

We understand that you have a choice in your executive selection process for your school. We also understand that you may be involved in a program with applicants ranging from ten to one hundred in number. Regardless of the situation, our product provides the most efficient officer-selection method by using only electronic resources and a standard template. [/p]

[h3]What are the Benefits of using OneApp?[/h3]

[p]Our hope with OneApp is that all organizations in the specific community will incorporate the OneApp system into their respective selection processes. OneApp generates a submission ".pdf" for administration viewing. Potential applicants will be able to fill out a single detailed form and then proceed to the corresponding supplements (if necessary). We offer a "win-win" situation for both parties in the process.

From an executive standpoint, the current officers would be able to re-use questions from previous documents. Furthermore, executives could easily upload supplements to request additional information not featured in the application itself.

From an applicant perspective, OneApp allows the individual to complete the main form once and then execute the remaining supplements.[/p]';
