<h1>Submitting different general application and peer recommendations</h1>

<p>You are recommended to submit the same general application and peer recommendation for all club applications. However, the system still allows you to submit different materials for each club.</p>

<p>To submit different general applications, simply modify the general application prior to club submission. For example, if you have one version you want to submit to Club A and another to Club B, first fill out the Club A version. Then, go to clubs, select Club A, and submit the application to Club A. For Club B, go back to your general application and fill out the Club B version. Then, go to clubs, select CLub B, and submit the application to Club B.</p>

<p>A similar process is used for peer recommendations. Instead of submitting different versions, you can enable or disable peer recommendations from the Peer page by selecting "Toggle state". Only completed and enabled peer recommendations will be submitted when you submit your application to a club.</p>
