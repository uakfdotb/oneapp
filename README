Get oneapp
----------

First, you will want to download the oneapp system. The recommended method is to do an SVN checkout:
	svn checkout http://oneapp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ oneapp

You probably want to export to get rid of svn directories:
	svn export oneapp oneapp_work

Alternatively, you can access the project page at http://code.google.com/p/oneapp/, select Downloads, and download the latest version.

Installation
------------

First, create a database and set it up with install.sql:
	mysql -u root -p
		[enter password]
		CREATE DATABASE oneapp;
		use oneapp;
		source path/to/oneapp/install.sql

You should also create a separate user with only permissions to modify the new database:
		GRANT ALL ON oneapp.* TO 'oneapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
		exit

Now, copy config_.php to config.php:
	cd path/to/oneapp
	cp config_.php config.php

Open up config.php in your favorite editor and set at least the following fields:
	db_name: the database name, 'oneapp' in this example
	db_hostname: the database host; 'localhost' if your MySQL server will be on the same server as your web server
	db_username: the database username, 'oneapp' in this example
	db_password: the database password, 'password' in this example
	
	mail_smtp: true if you wish to send mail through SMTP, or false to send directly (via PHP mail() command)
	mail_username: the email address to send from; also SMTP username if using mail_smtp
	mail_password: the password if sending through another mail server
	mail_smtp_host: the host if sending through another mail server; protocol should be included (like ssl://smtp.gmail.com)
	mail_smtp_port: the port if sending through another mail server; default 25 if no encryption, 465 if SSL
	
	site_name: the name of the website
	organization_name: the name of your organization (e.g., the school name)
	site_address: URL where oneapp will be accessed later

Good job! You're done configuring oneapp. Now, you still need to install a few packages for oneapp to work (assuming you already have a webserver, PHP, and MySQL). On Debian and similar systems:
	sudo aptitude install texlive-latex-recommended php-pear

If mail_smtp is true:
	pear install Net_SMTP Mail

Alright, now copy over oneapp to your webroot:
	cp -r oneapp /var/www/oneapp

And go to [site_address] and see if everything is working properly.

To set up the initail user, head to [site_address]/install.
Now, you should be able to login at [site_address]/login.php.
Then head to [site_address]/root to enter the root administration area.
