Installation
------------
Apply the patch. Then, execute:
	ALTER TABLE clubs ADD COLUMN limitcat VARCHAR(16);
	CREATE TABLE club_limits (limitcat VARCHAR(16), lim INT);

Also add man_limit to configuration file as root_side_display.

Usage
-----
Edit limit categories through the clubs manager. Then, set limits on specific limit categories in the new limits manager sidebar item in root management area.

Note that users will not be notified until they attempt to submit a supplement that there is a limit. However, there is an addition to the club pages that will show the limit category and the limit for that category.
